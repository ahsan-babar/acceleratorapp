# Auto-generated Calendar Events Integration
The project provides auto-generated calendar events integration solution powered by 
by Node.js, Express.js &amp; GraphQL.

## Application Server
The application server is built on top of Express.js. It exposes the following operational endpoints on 4000 port:
- ### GET /events/:username
     Restful API endpoint to fetch auto-generated calender events 
- ### GET /graphql
     GraphQL endpoint to query the synced calendar events from the database

## Sync Job
The application has a sync job that repeats itself after an interval of 1 hour to consume the autogenerated calendar events using the Restful API endpoint and dumps the events to MongoDB
